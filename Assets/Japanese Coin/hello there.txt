Hey, 
thanks for downloading this freebie. I hope you will find it useful C:
It is a little bit heavy on poly count and the texture resolution is too big for such an insignificant prop but I thought you could always downscale it or use as a character related prop with given resolution.
I'd appreciate if in return you could have a look at my asset store page and maybe find something useful for your projects.
If you have any specific props/models requests that have some sort of mass appeal - feel free to drop them via email.
My ultimate goal is to make my asset packs as good as possible so if you have any advices on how to run my asset store - I'm all ears.


All the best,
Your potato friend
