Playful interaction, reading about your mental fitness :)

The main scene is the scene under ‘Assets/NatureStarterKit2/Scene/Demo.unity’.



Also there is Android wear app (for Android watch) for measurinng heart rate. path: ./android_app

The idea was to capture heart rate and send it to Realtime Google Analytics account to analyse game performance and heart rate relation.
